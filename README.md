## Project 1
* The data contains the selling prices of different houses based on different characteristics/attributes like area, no. of rooms, no. of bathrooms, etc.
At times, the property dealers appreciate the prices based on the demand and hence there is a rise in prices in real estate. So, in order to cope with this problem so that it is beneficial for the customers, we must have a model in place which should tell us the ideal prices of the house based on its characteristics.
* The objective of the project is to predict the ideal prices of the houses based on their characteristics using a regression algorithm

## Project 2
* The dataset contains the information like personal information of the customer, transaction information, and bank information belonging to a bank. It is often necessary to predict when the customers are going to withdraw their money from the bank account and stay dormant. Being able to predict this, the bank can take necessary action to prevent customers from withdrawing huge sums and stay an active/loyal customers. 
* Our task is to be able to predict the customers who are going to churn based on the information given.

These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customer segments that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.
